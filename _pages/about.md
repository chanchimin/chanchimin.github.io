I am currently pursuing my PhD (second year) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Yike Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-0q6cIYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Wei Xue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=77lSoywAAAAJ). Before I entered HKUST, I obtained my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University and had the privilege of working with the [THUNLP](https://github.com/thunlp) group under the guidance of [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dT0v5u0AAAAJ), which was a transformative experience in my academic journey.

My research interests are primarily in the areas of 

**(1)** Efficient tuning of Large Language Models 

**(2)** Applications of LLM-Based Agents 

**(3)** Currently focusing on data mixture for improved LLM pretraining. 

I have authored several publications, which you can find listed [here](https://chanchimin.github.io/publications). I am always open to collaboration, whether you are 

**(1)** an experienced researcher seeking someone to handle coding tasks, 

**(2)** a peer looking for open discussions, or 

**(3)** a beginner who might benefit from my guidance where I can provide one-on-one discussions and computational resources. 

Please feel free to reach out via email at <a href="mailto:zorowin123@gmail.com">zorowin123@gmail.com</a>. I am more than happy to help and will reply as promptly as possible.

Additionally, I am actively seeking internship opportunities in industry or academia for the next summer (<span style="color: red;">2025</span>). If you have any suitable opportunities or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out.
